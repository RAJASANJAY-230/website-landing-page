# website-landing-page
This code creates a static web page that visually resembles the Google search homepage in dark mode. It uses HTML to structure the page into a header, main content area, and footer, and CSS to apply styling such as dark background colors, centered alignment, rounded search bar, buttons, and responsive layout. The page includes navigation links, a Google-style logo, a search input box with icons, action buttons, language options, and a footer with region and policy links. The design is responsive and focuses only on appearance, without any real search functionality or backend logic.
No real search functionality
The original Google page connects to Google’s servers and performs live searches; this code is only visual.

No JavaScript or AI features
Google uses advanced JavaScript, AI, and APIs (voice search, image search, AI mode); this code does not.

No authentication or user data
Original Google supports login, personalization, and history; this page has none.

No accessibility optimizations
Google includes advanced accessibility, ARIA roles, and keyboard navigation.

Different fonts and icons
The original uses proprietary fonts and SVG icons, while this uses basic fonts and emojis.

No security or privacy handling
Google includes cookies, privacy controls, and secure connections; this code does not.
